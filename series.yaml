# Edit the configuration below (writen in `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_) and then
# call `/bootstrap` to overwrite the `Series`.  By convention:
# 
# * series are displayed (e.g.: in the library category nav) in the order they
#   are listed below
# * images for the series are looked up using `gfx/series/${value}.png`, 
#   e.g.: `gfx/series/a.png`, so save them in the corresponding `./gfx/series`
#   folder inside `wikihouse-resources`.
