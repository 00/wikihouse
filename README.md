This repository contains the code and documentation for the [WikiHouse]
open community construction platform.

The application runs on [Google App Engine].  It depends on two other repos:

* [wikihouse-resources]
* [weblayer-dependencies]

You need [wikihouse-resources] inside `$AMPIFY_ROOT/third_party` and
[weblayer-dependencies] as `./third_party`.  To bootstrap the app data
open `/bootstrap` in your browser (as an admin).

All work in this repository has been released into the Public Domain.
You are welcome to use it however you wish.
